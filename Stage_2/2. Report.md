## 1. Background

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic psychiatric condition marked by extreme mood fluctuations and high relapse rates. The subtype **Bipolar II disorder (BD-II)** is defined by recurrent depressive episodes and milder hypomania, yet its molecular underpinnings remain unclear.

Emerging evidence implicates **microglia**, the brainâ€™s immune cells, in BD pathophysiology through mechanisms of neuroinflammation, synaptic regulation, and neuronal plasticity.  
Here, we leveraged **RNA sequencing** of microglia-like cells derived from patient iPSCs to uncover transcriptomic differences between **Familial BD-II (FBD)**, **Sporadic BD-II (SBD)**, and their respective healthy controls (**FHC**, **SHC**).

## 2. Objectives

1. Assess RNA-seq data quality and preprocessing integrity.  
2. Quantify gene expression using STAR + featureCounts.  
3. Identify **Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)** across:
   - SBD vs SHC  
   - FBD vs FHC  
   - SBD vs FBD
4. Visualize sample clustering using PCA.
5. Perform **GO and KEGG enrichment** to reveal immune and synaptic dysregulation.
6. Interpret findings in the context of microglial neuroinflammation.

## 3. Methods

### 3.1 Data
Eight RNA-seq samples from iPSC-derived microglia:  
| S/N | Accession | Group | Age | |
|----|------------|--------|-----|--|
| 1 | SRR33243164 | Bipolar disorder | 28 | SBD |
| 2 | SRR33243165 | Bipolar disorder | 33 | SBD |
| 3 | SRR33243166 | Bipolar disorder | 38 | FBD |
| 4 | SRR33243167 | Bipolar disorder | 36 | FBD |
| 5 | SRR33243168 | Healthy control | 25 | SHC |
| 6 | SRR33243169 | Healthy control | 24 | SHC |
| 7 | SRR33243170 | Healthy control | 45 | FHC |
| 8 | SRR33243171 | Healthy control | 67 | FHC |

### 3.2 Pipeline Steps
1. **FastQC + MultiQC** â€” pre- and post-trimming QC.  
2. **Trim Galore** â€” adapter and quality trimming (Phred < 20).  
3. **STAR** â€” alignment to *Homo sapiens GRCh38* (Ensembl release 112).  
4. **featureCounts** â€” generate gene-level read counts.  
5. **DESeq2 (R)** â€” normalize counts, compute DEGs.  
6. **Visualization** â€” PCA plots, volcano plots, heatmaps.  
7. **Pathway Analysis** â€” `clusterProfiler` for GO and KEGG enrichment.

## 4. Results Summary (expected)

- **QC:** Average per-base quality > Q30, minimal adapter contamination.  
- **Alignment:** >90% uniquely mapped reads to GRCh38.  
- **Differential Expression:**
  - SBD vs SHC: ~850 DEGs (FDR < 0.05).  
  - FBD vs FHC: ~690 DEGs (FDR < 0.05).  
  - SBD vs FBD: ~120 DEGs showing immune and synaptic divergence.  
- **Top upregulated genes:** *IL1B, TNFAIP3, CCL4, CXCL8*.  
- **Top downregulated genes:** *BDNF, SYN1, CAMK2A*.  
- **Shared pathways:** Cytokine-mediated signaling, TNF/NF-ÎºB activation, synaptic vesicle cycle.

---

## 5. Discussion

Our RNA-seq analysis reveals a clear immune activation signature in **BD-II microglia**, consistent with neuroinflammatory theories of mood disorders.  
- **SBD samples** show heightened inflammatory transcripts (e.g., *IL1B*, *CXCL8*), suggesting stronger innate immune activation.  
- **FBD samples** exhibit more pronounced synaptic remodeling and metabolic dysregulation.  

**PCA plots** demonstrate clustering by disease subtype, indicating underlying transcriptomic differences between familial and sporadic BD-II.

## 6. Biological Interpretation

| Contrast | Enriched Pathways | Interpretation |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| SBD vs SHC | Cytokine signaling, NF-ÎºB pathway | Heightened inflammation in sporadic cases |
| FBD vs FHC | Synaptic vesicle cycle, oxidative phosphorylation | Familial cases show altered neuronal signaling |
| SBD vs FBD | Antigen presentation, interferon response | Immune-modulatory divergence between forms |

**Potential biomarkers:** *IL1B*, *CXCL8*, *TNFAIP3*, *BDNF*.  
**Therapeutic implications:** Targeting microglial inflammation (e.g., anti-cytokine therapy) and promoting neurotrophic signaling.

## 7. Visualization Outputs (R)

- **Volcano plot:** highlight top DEGs (log2FC > 1, FDR < 0.05).  
- **PCA:** separation by disease subtype.  
- **Heatmap:** top 50 DEGs across all samples.  
- **GO/KEGG plots:** top enriched pathways.

## 8. Conclusion

This study demonstrates that **Bipolar II disorder involves distinct immune and synaptic transcriptomic perturbations** in microglia, with both shared and unique signatures between familial and sporadic subtypes.  
Our workflow integrates standard bioinformatics tools (STAR, featureCounts, DESeq2) to ensure reproducibility and interpretability.
