###Project Details: Submit markdown or code solution to the project below

##Stage 0 Project 1: BASh Basic You are to achieve this short story with the command line alone.

Your submission should be a simple script with listing the solution to each task below

Important: Upload your script to GitHub

Linkedin: As a team, make a video record of your solution and upload to LinkedIn or X.

Absence of these two in your script will make them rejected outrightly.

###Project 1: BASh Basic

#1. Print your name

#2. Create a folder titled your name

#3. Create another new directory titled biocomputing and change to that directory with one line of command

#4. Download these 3 files: #https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josoga2/dataset-repos/main/wildtype.fna #https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josoga2/dataset-repos/main/wildtype.gbk #https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josoga2/dataset-repos/main/wildtype.gbk

#5. Move the .fna file to the folder titled your name

#6. Delete the duplicate gbk file

#7. Confirm if the .fna file is mutant or wild type (tatatata vs tata)

#8. If mutant, print all matching lines into a new file

#9. Count number of lines (excluding header) in the .gbk file

#10. Print the sequence length of the .gbk file. (Use the LOCUS tag in the first line)

#11. Print the source organism of the .gbk file. (Use the SOURCE tag in the first line)

#12. List all the gene names of the .gbk file. Hint {grep '/gene='}

#13. Clear your terminal space and print all commands used today

#14. List the files in the two folders and share a screenshot of your terminal

###Project 2: Installing Bioinformatics Software on the Terminal #N/B: You need to install and setup your conda environment with either Anaconda or Miniconda. Please copy exactly what worked. Do not paraphrase. A single mismatch makes you lose your point.

#1. Activate your base conda environment

#2. Create a conda environment named funtools

#3. Activate the funtools environment #4. Install Figlet using conda

#5. Run figlet

#6. Install bwa through the bioconda channel

#7. Install blast through the bioconda channel

#8. Install samtools through the bioconda channel

#9. Install bedtools through the bioconda channel

#10. Install spades.py through the bioconda channel

#11. Install bcftools through the bioconda channel

#12. Install fastp through the bioconda channel

#13. Install multiqc through the bioconda channel

##Professional Profile #1. Upload the full set of codes on GitHub (See how to upload to github here) #2. As a team, create a video explaining your submissions step by step to be uploaded on LinkedIn (Ensure your admins see them before you upload on LinkedIn)
